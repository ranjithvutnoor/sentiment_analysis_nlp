# sentiment_analysis_nlp

Here I used restaurant reviews collection dataset  for sentiment analysis.
classification of the reviews based on the response it is positive or negative comment, used Naive Bayes classification model got accuracy of 70%, and also I need to test on other classification models for the more acuracy in predicting.
